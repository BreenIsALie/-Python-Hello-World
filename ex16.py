# Read and write to files. This script is a text editor

# Import argv for use with command line
from sys import argv

print "Opening the file..."
target = open(filename, "w")  # Open the file specified by the command line

print "Truncating the file. Goodbye!"
target.truncate()  # Erase the file content

print "Now i'm going to ask you for three lines"

# User input goes here
line1 = raw_input("Line 1: ")
line2 = raw_input("Line 2: ")
line3 = raw_input("Line 3: ")

print "I'm going to write these to the file"

target.write("\n")
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)

# Close the file, ending the interaction
print "And finally, we close it"
